# ENDANGERED ANIMALS

## Presentation
To make this project we have used the endangered animals theme. It is very important to give information about this because it is becoming a real preocupation lately.

Humans are the main reason of the endagered animals so we are the ones who have to take awareness of it because with extincted animals the world is running worse. Animals are vital for the performance of the earth and we have to protect them. 

Some of the main causes of the endangered animals are poaching and the contamination mainly on seas and forests. About poaching, it is produced due to the black market of the leather, organs, etc of those animals. Another cause of the endangered animals is the deforestation because a lot of animals needs trees and plants to live like birds, insects or a lot of herbivorous animals.

In this project we are going to make our website about some of the endangered animals, the main causes of their extinction or almost extinction and how some enterprises are trying to protect them and how they explain to us to support to protect them.

We are also going to talk about some laws and some countries that "contribute" on the extinction of some animals like Japan with the whales haunting.

The structure of our website is based on different subclasses of animals. We have divided it on Mammals, Birds and Reptiles. Then we talk about consciousness of endangered animals. 

Inside any topic, we have some descriptions of some specific animals, some audios to show you how these animals sounds, images to see the animals we are talking about and some videos. 

## User Interface
The webpage is organized using html and some CSS tools like tables or lists to make it easier to visit.

The interface is a simple but effective interface that we think it is very effective. We have choosen a lion photo as the background of the main page and the first thing you see is the tittle with a very striking yellow color and then the different topics of our page. You can click on the tittle of any subpage to go directly to their information. On every subpage of our website there is a link on the bottom of the page to go to the main page and on the main page there is the contact form to send us some doubts or anything

### Mammals

In the mammals section we can see a table with information, an image and an audio of each animal. Then scrolling down we find a description of mammals and a video.

### Birds

Inside birds section we have three different subsections depending if birds are terrestrial, aquatic or beachy.

In the terrestrial, and the aquatic section we have a very similar structure of the Mammals one. There are some differences when you scroll down because we have different organisation for the information. For example in the aquatic one we liked to make a left and right separation of information.

With the beachy one we opt for doing a totally different view of the page with a more common style explaining the information of each animal just below their images.

### Reptiles

And with reptiles we have done almost the same as the beachy birds but we also included some audios

### Consciousness

In the consiousness page we have choosen again a common style with some ordered and unordered lists, images and so on

This is a kind of [sketch or draft](RELATORIO/boceto.pdf)

With this skecth we can see how we wanted to made the project and the final result is on the webpage. There are some differences but not very important like on the birds topic that we mixed the structure with the reptiles.

This is the code of the [sitemap.xml](RELATORIO/sitemap.xml)

On the sitemap we can see all the links to our website and their subpages.

## Product

#### Description and link
About the product, it is a website that talks about some endangered animals, the main causes of extinction, some characteristics and how to raise awareness on people about the endangered animals

[Link to the page](https://whimsical-sunburst-d3c632.netlify.app/)

#### Configuration and installation
For the well configuration of the web page and correct installation we must follow this steps: 
- Create a Netlify Account: Start by signing up for a Netlify account at https://inf22tig08.netlify.app/ if you haven't already.

- Connect a Git Repository: To deploy web pages. Connect the desired repository by linking it to your Netlify account. This connection enables automatic deployments whenever you push changes to your repository.

Configure Build Settings: These settings specify how Netlify builds and deploys our site. This configuration ensures that the web page is built correctly during deployment

Then we need to move into production deploys and download the web page by the download buttom next to published deploy

#### Usage rules
There are not usage rules on our websites, but there are some limitations because any user cannot modify the webpage, it is only an information webpage with no interaction but to inform people.

#### Navigation help
We think our webpage is a very intuitive site so there is no need of help with the navigation. You just have to click on the names of any page and you will automatically be viewing the information of any page. The main page is organised by some lists with hided links inside the names and that is all.

#### Forms validation
To make the forms validation we use an external website to receive the forms. [Formspree](https://formspree.io/) The website works this way:

The developers register on formspree so it gives an endpoint for the forms the people write and then any form is sent to the registration mail the developers used before.

#### HTML and CSS validation
The validation of these files are done with [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/)

The method of validating is to upload every file and W3C will warn about the errors or some warnings that the file can have.

#### Details
About the details it is better to see the presentation rather than explaining them here.
